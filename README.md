## üõ†Ô∏è Key SQL Concepts Used

1. **`GROUP BY` Clause**:  
   Used to group data based on specific columns for aggregation.

2. **Aggregate Functions**:  
   - `AVG()`: Calculates average values.  
   - `SUM()`: Computes total values.  
   - `MAX()` / `MIN()`: Finds maximum and minimum values.  
   - `COUNT()`: Counts rows or specific column values.

3. **`HAVING` Clause**:  
   Filters grouped data based on aggregate conditions.

4. **Joins**:  
   - `INNER JOIN`: Combines data from `emp` and `dept` tables based on `deptno`.

5. **Filtering**:  
   - `WHERE` clause for row-level filtering.  
   - `LIKE` operator for pattern matching.
